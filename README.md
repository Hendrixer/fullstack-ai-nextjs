This is a companion repo for the [Build an AI Powered Fullstack App with Next.js, v3][course] course on [Frontend Masters][fem]. This application is built from scratch throughout the course. The `main` branch contains a final version of the application similar to the one built in the course. The other branches in the repo are code checkpoints which can be used as a starting point for specific lessons.

## Getting Started

The [course][course] covers the full process of building and deploying the application. The steps below summarize a few of the key requirements.

### Create a new Next.js Project

We recommend using Node version `18.x.x` and Next.js version `13.4.5` for this course.

```bash
npx create-next-app@13.4.5 mood
npm run dev
```

### Install Clerk

Clerk is the third-party authentication provider for the application

```bash
npm i @clerk/nextjs
```

**Add Clerk secrets to .env.local**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXXXXX
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/journal
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/new-user
```
